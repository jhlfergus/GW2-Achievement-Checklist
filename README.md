Guild Wars 2 Achievement Checklist

Hi everyone,

I've developed a Guild Wars 2 Achievement Checklist application to help track achievements more efficiently. You can download it using the link below:

Download Link: https://github.com/jhlfergus/GW2-Achievement-Checklist/blob/main/GW2%20Achievement%20Tracker.zip

Instructions:

Download the Application: Click on the link and download the GuildWars2Achievements.exe and other associated files.

Run the Application: Double-click the GuildWars2Achievements.exe file to start the application.

No installation is required.

Security Warning: Windows may display a warning because the application is from an unknown publisher. Click More info and then Run anyway if prompted.

Enter Your API Key: To track your achievement progress so you don't have to enter each one automatically, click File, and then select the option to enter your own Guild Wars 2 API key. You can obtain an API key from the Guild Wars 2 Account Management page.

Using the Application: Explore the features and customize your achievement tracking.

Virus Scan: For your peace of mind, I ran the application through VirusTotal. Here's the report: https://www.virustotal.com/gui/url/cfde6b984fe2ede4b80c7998bfb1d355e9b8c26c9640c7f3fea4bb6f939c9df3?nocache=1

Feedback: I'd love to hear your thoughts and any suggestions you might have.
