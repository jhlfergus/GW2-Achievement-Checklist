Guild Wars 2 Achievement Checklist

Hi everyone,

I've developed a Guild Wars 2 Achievement Checklist application to help track achievements more efficiently. You can download it using the link below:

Download Link: https://github.com/jhlfergus/GW2-Achievement-Checklist/blob/main/GW2%20Achievement%20Tracker.zip

Instructions:

Download the Application: Click on the link and download the GuildWars2Achievements.exe and other associated files.

Run the Application: Double-click the GuildWars2Achievements.exe file to start the application.

No installation is required.

Security Warning: Windows may display a warning because the application is from an unknown publisher. Click More info and then Run anyway if prompted.

Enter Your API Key: To track your achievement progress so you don't have to enter each one automatically, click File, and then select the option to enter your own Guild Wars 2 API key. You can obtain an API key from the Guild Wars 2 Account Management page.

Using the Application: Explore the features and customize your achievement tracking.

Virus Scan: For your peace of mind, I ran the application through VirusTotal. Here's the report: https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/c0f09dfb8003ee8b4f5c5305224793abca50511a1388abea1f10e2e4045b5b43/detection

One file did get flagged, but here is a year old Reddit thread where others are discussing that it is a false positive: https://www.reddit.com/r/antivirus/comments/wlkud8/trojanmalware300983susgen_false_positive

Here is another thread about it from bleepingcomputer.com discussing the same thing: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/t/753079/i-got-infected-by-trojanmalware300983susgen-from-downloading-ngrok-help/page-2

Use your best judgement and don't do anything that you feel uncomfortable about, but I use this app every day.

Feedback: I'd love to hear your thoughts and any suggestions you might have.
